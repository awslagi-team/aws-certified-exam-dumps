What is the most likely reason for this?

        A. The source DB instance has to be converted to Single-AZ first to create a read replica from it.
        B. Enhanced Monitoring is not enabled on the source DB instance.
        C. The minor MySQL version in the source DB instance does not support read replicas.
        D. Automated backups are not enabled on the source DB instance.

Answer: D

40. A Database Specialist has migrated an on-premises Oracle database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The schema and the data have been migrated successfully. The on-premises database server was also being used to run database maintenance cron jobs written in Python to perform tasks including data purging and generating data exports. The logs for these jobs show that, most of the time, the jobs completed within 5 minutes, but a few jobs took up to 10 minutes to complete.
